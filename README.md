amateur admins alike.

## apt_install_history.py

This is meant to ease the pain of sifting through dpkg logs and making long
1-liners to sift info. Will take the contents of /var/log/dpkg.log.* and output
to stdout.

./apt_install_history.py [-a|-c|-s] [-n <int>]

flags:
  -a, --all :
  		Prints every line of every dpkg.log file
  -c, --command_code :
  		Prints every line of an action (install|remove|purge)
  -s, --status_code :
  		Prints every line of package status (installed|not-installed)
  -n, --number :
  		Number of lines to print (starting from most recent)
